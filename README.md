# BBNI-Historical-Price-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project presents an exploratory and analytical study of BBNI (Bank Negara Indonesia) historical stock data from 2019–2026. The objective is to analyze price trends, risk dynamics, return performance, and the relationship between price and trading volume using Python and Tableau.
The final output is an interactive financial dashboard built in Tableau.

## Objectives
- Analyze historical price movement
- Measure stock volatility
- Evaluate annual return performance
- Compare short-term and medium-term moving averages
- Examine correlation between price and trading volume

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas (data cleaning & transformation)
- NumPy (calculation)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (EDA visualization)
- Tableau Public
- Dashboard visualization
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Analysis
1️. Historical Price Trend
- Significant drop in 2020 (market shock period)
- Strong recovery from 2021 onwards
- Uptrend peak observed around 2024–2025
2️. Volatility (20-Day Rolling)
- Highest volatility during 2020 crisis
- Stabilization period post-2022
3️. Annual Return
- Negative return in 2020
- Strong positive return in 2022
- Fluctuating yearly performance, indicating cyclical behavior
4️. Moving Average (MA20 vs MA50)
- Used to identify short-term vs medium-term trends
- Several crossover points indicating momentum shifts
5️. Price vs Volume Correlation
- Weak correlation observed across year
- Volume spikes do not consistently predict price movement

## Insights
The analysis shows that BBNI demonstrates cyclical behavior influenced by macroeconomic conditions.
While recovery trends are visible post-2020, return volatility and weak price-volume correlation indicate moderate risk characteristics.
